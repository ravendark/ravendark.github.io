summary: A whirlwind of changes in my life
---

Well, it certainly has been a while since I have posted. A lot has changed
recently, and very quickly at that. Second Term of school has started. Nothing
really major here, General Education courses for the most part. It's going well
overall, if a little slower than I expected due to other life events. Which
brings me to...

I have managed, quite unexpectedly, to switch jobs, and buildings, twice in the
last few months. It's been a ride, for sure. Way back in May 2023 I applied
for a few Internal job postings. I got an offer on one that seemed interesting.
It combined several skill sets I had acquired over the years, and I thought it
would be a good opportunity. The commute was rough, but doable, if only for a
little while. So I accepted the offer, with a late July start date, and began
to train a replacement for duties in my current role. No worries, plenty of
time to get it done.

And so it was I wrapped up my time in Dupont and started up at a new building
in Arlington.  It was a great learning experience for me. I got great hands-on
experience in managing a large group of people. Time management, and systems
exposure I hadn't had before.

I got into a comfortable routine, Dock Clerk is at once predictable, and on
occasion, utter chaos.  A few months in, I was showing some of my New Hire
Associates how to find internal job postings for specific building locations.
Out of habit, I searched my old building for open requisitions.  

I didn't think much of it. Walked the associates through the process as an
example.  Imagine my surprise, when a few days later I was making arrangements
to train an associate to replace me, so the project could finish, and 2 weeks
later, I'm in a new role at my original building!  

It's been challenging to learn how to drive PIT, but overall I'm having a great
experience.

I'll post more as time goes on.
