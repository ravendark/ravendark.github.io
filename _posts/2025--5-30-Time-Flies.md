I had intentions of updating this place on the regular. And here we are, like a
year or more since my last post. I really do need to change that. I'm still
doing pretty much what I was back then. Although some minor things have
changed. I put a pause on school for a bit, WGU just wasn't clicking with me.
Outdated material, bare bones if present collaboration tools, it just wasn't
making for a good experience. I have a former co-worker going to SNHU that says
it's much better, and more fun. So I think I'm going to get into a cohort there
starting in a couple of months.

I wanted to learn Vim, so what to do, well, write a book, obviously. Yep!, I
decided I wanted to get more comfortable using Vim, so a friend suggested,
"If you really want to learn it, You have to commit with it. Write a book" Now,
no one else will likely ever see it. But I have actually written like 8
chapters to a story that will most likely go nowhere. The experience however,
has made me more comfortable using Vim.

Time will tell. Who knows, maybe one day it will actually be good enough to
post somewhere. For now though, the exercise itself has been great.
