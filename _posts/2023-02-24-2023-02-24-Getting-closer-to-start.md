Coming up on March 1st really quick. I have all the pre-requisites completed aside from one. Which is A
meeting with my Program Mentor. Missed his call due to a phone setting and had to reschedule. It's no big
deal, didn't delay my start or anything.

I've been absorbing some quick courses on LinkedIn Learning to re-familiarize myself with MS Office, and reading up on APA Style for papers, as that is the Style WGU uses.

I've spent quite a bit of time learning the WGU website and browsing the Knowledge Base, which is quite extensive.
It will take me a while to get back into the swing of things for sure. But I'm really looking forward to getting
started.
