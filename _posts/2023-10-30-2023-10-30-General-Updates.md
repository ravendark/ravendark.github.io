summary: Feelings starting week 3 of the new job.
---

I must say, even though I really miss the people I was working with
up at PAE2, I'm very happy to be back at BFI3. A lot of folks I worked
with previously are still there. So it's been great catching up with
everyone.

I haven't reached out to the replacement I trained before coming back,
but I'll send her a slack tomorrow while I'm at work. I want her to
know she can reach out for help. My schedule is different, but I can
still help with questions or advice.

I haven't seen her logged onto slack for a few days, so I want to check
in and see how things are going. Might be that the pod transfers are
finished. And they have moved her on to something else. I'll see
soon enough.

Overall, I'm pleased I accepted the offer. Non-Inventory is a lot
of fun. I still have much to learn, but so far things have been
going really well.

I'll chime back in as things progress.
