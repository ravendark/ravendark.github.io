title: Up and Running!
---
Almost everything should be up and running. Social Media links should be working.
Duscqus comments are integrated. And the About page is updated.

I've even got everthing on my main github profile updated!

More to come as I get the Admissions process completed and start getting the
computer ready for the adventure.

Oh! and I have to find a good blog plugin for neovim and or VS Code.
But that shouldn't be to difficult.
