This blog is being setup mainly as sort of living notebook. I've recently enrolled for
a Bachelors of Science in Software Engineering. My hope is that this blog will help
chronical my journey, but also offer something toward a portfolio down the road.

I mean, I will eventually add a portfolio section here. But I think the blog itself
might add a little extra something on top of that when the time comes.
