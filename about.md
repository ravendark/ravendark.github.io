Greetings! My name is Scott, but around the internet I'm mostly known under
the monicer of ravendark. I grew up in South West PA (think Pittsburgh), but
the last few years have been living in Tacoma, WA.

I've been interested in technology of various forms from a very young age. I think
around 8 or 9, was when I helped my dad put together a Radio Shack branded
computer kit. We're talking soldering the keyboard together from a pre-printed
board, then connecting to a tape deck and crt TV.

We have come a very long way indeed.



### More Information

I currently work for Amazon at one of many Fullfilment Centers in my area of Washington.
I'm about to start working toward my Bachelors of Science in Software Engineering.
For which I hope to use this blog as kind of a journal and notebook.
Then later a portfolio. But we'll get to that later.

If you are so inclined, you can check out the social media links in the footer
of these pages to see what I might be up to at any given point.
